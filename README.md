Gentoo enjoyer is here. I like neovim and tmux, and like making projects which brings me joy.
One of such things in my TODO list is to make a statically typed programming language without any modern bloated technology.
Id really like to tickle those rdi and rsi...

Currently working on [DDNet Team Searcher](https://github.com/DDNet-Team-Searcher)â„¢.

Also Im kinda jobless so it would be great to find a job. I know JS, learning Go and can print "Hello, World!" in Rust.
If you hire me Ill bubble sort your array as much as you want me to.
